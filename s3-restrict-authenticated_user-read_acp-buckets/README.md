This workflow looks at all of the S3 buckets in a given account and restricts those that provide 'READ' access to all Authenticated Users. 

It evaluates all buckets for a grant that includes:
- Group containing "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers"  
- Permission containing "READ" 

These buckets will be restricted to be 'private'. 

## Prerequisites

Before you run this workflow, you will need the following:
- An AWS account.
- An AWS IAM user with permissions to list and modify S3 buckets (if not
  run in dry run mode).
- One or more S3 buckets that provide 'READ' access to all Authenticated Users.

## Run the workflow

Follow these steps to run the workflow:
1. Add your AWS credentials as a Connection:
   1. Click **Setup** 
   2. Find the Connection named `my-aws-account` and click Edit(âœŽ). Use the following values:
      - **KEY**: `ACCESS KEY ID`
      - **VALUE**: Enter your AWS access key id associated with the account
      - **KEY**: `SECRET ACCESS KEY`
      - **VALUE**: Enter your AWS secret access key associated with the account
   3. Click **Save**
      
2. Click **Run workflow** and wait for the workflow run page to appear.
3. Supply following parameters to the modal:
   - **KEY**: `dryRun`
   - **VALUE**: True if you don't want to perform actual WRITE operations

4. **Warning:** If you run the workflow with the `dryRun` parameter set to
   `false`, buckets not in compliance with this workflow policy will
   immediately be modified to be 'private'.
